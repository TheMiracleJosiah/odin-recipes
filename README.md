# odin-recipes

This is an Odin project work which instructs me to make a recipe website only using HTML

The project tests my knowledge of Git,Github,Bash terminal and writing basic HTMl.

At this point, I have completed the project and i was able to use HTML elements and tags such as <img>,<p>,the default boileplate templat for HTML etc.

I have concluded that i have gained a solid foundation and background of baasic HTML, Git, Github and Command line commands.
